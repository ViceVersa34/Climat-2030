                <h2 class="yello-txt">Manifesto : We are in danger.</h2>
                <p>
                    Scientists prove every day that we have been producing greenhouse gases for nearly 200 years at an exceptional 
                    rate compared to centuries ago. Those fossil fuels no longer dissipate in the atmosphere because there are too 
                    many and continue to be added, which is why there is a warming climate around the world. <br><br>

                    The alert was issued as early as 1896, but it is only now that we are beginning to see the effects. Companies 
                    still continue to produce more and more greenhouse gases every day with no legal action by the world’s politics 
                    to ensure our safety and health. <br><br>

                    Companies and countries have one thing in common: 82% of them are run by men of a certain age who decide 
                    universally. Choices and decisions are de facto biased without the advice, counsel and consent of the other 
                    half of humanity, women.<br><br>

                    Imagine if, in past centuries, women but also young people and all those who feel being a minority, had been 
                    so much decision-makers and responsible for our common good, the Earth? <br>
                    History would not have been the same. Our survival might not be in danger today. <br><br>

                    We all need to metamorphosis into climate virtuoso for humanity to survive beyond 2030. We need women, young 
                    people, those who think being a minority, to have the audacity to play the game if we want to win.  <br><br>

                    Hubert Reeves once said: «Man leads a fight against Nature, if he wins, he loses».

                    <p>
                        I created Climat-2030 to stop the bleeding, to avoid the 16 irreversible tipping points from being reached. 
                        I would like to participate in organizing a new sustainable society which respect for Living comes before 
                        individual freedom.

                    <h3 class="yello-txt size-txt font-weight">What made me started.</h3>
                    <p>
                        On the one hand, the 2030 deadline and beyond to maintain 1.5°C of global warming, on the other hand the 
                        eco anxiety of my son.

                    <h3 class="yello-txt size-txt font-weight">What made me want to help others and provide the services I offer.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Empowering women means helping to limit global warming and the destruction of the Living because women’s 
                        modus vivendi relies on education and ability to organize the change. <br>
                        At the same time, deconstructing patriarchy means building a society without toxic virility that is costly 
                        for humanity and carbon. Women must co-lead the world.

                    <h3 class="yello-txt size-txt font-weight">Why I keep moving forward.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every day the bad news rains, our survival on Earth is counted and we continue to live as before the pandemic 
                        when we saw during the pandemic that another way of life is possible, that everything can change and in just 
                        a few days ! <br>
                        When we realize that we are going straight to the wall, we have no choice but to act.  <span class="yello-txt">
                            We must educate ourselves and then act.</span>.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="yello-txt size-txt font-weight">Do I feel that my purpose guides me ?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Yes. I feel compelled. We must become collectively aware of the major problem of the 21st Century in order to 
                        act to change the situation and change our behaviour habits. Individually and collectively.
