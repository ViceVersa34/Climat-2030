                            They must have the power to lead in order to decide and ensure that our humanity is preserved. They must redefine the essential priorities and 
                            ensure respect for the rights of human beings and all living beings in the world. This will increase our chances of containing 1.5°C warming by

                            We need women to look at the conduct of our future. Our future depends on it.
