                    Understand that fighting global warming and women's empowerment are linked. Still too few  <span class="yello-txt">women are decision makers</span>
                    of the trajectories to give to our societies all over the world.<br><br>
                    They must have the power to lead in order to decide and ensure that our humanity is preserved. They must redefine the essential priorities and 
                    ensure respect for the rights of human beings and all living beings in the world. This will increase our chances of containing 1.5°C warming by 
                    2030 and beyond. <br><br>
                    We need women to look at the conduct of our future. Our future depends on it.

                    <span class="yello-txt">Humorous show</span> about the link between the impact of the patriarchal model of society and global warming. The show looks like a 
                    <span class="yello-txt">conference punctuated with music and videos</span>, led by a woman in crisis. The idea is to demonstrate the benefits of women's 
                    emancipation for our future, without male domination, without climate threat and respectful of the Living.
